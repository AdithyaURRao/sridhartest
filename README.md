Commvault Developer Rest API Documentation
Welcome
--------------
Here are some pre-made requests for you to explore the API using [Postman](https://getpostman.com).

Setup
--------------
NOTE: You'll need to [create an environment in Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/environments), select that environment, and enter your Web Service URL, userName and Base64 Encoded Password in the `0 - Setup/Environment Setup` pre-request script ([documentation on pre-request scripts](http://www.getpostman.com/docs/pre_request_scripts)) to set the environment variables.  Also, the calls have dependencies. `GET`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE` calls will only work after an item is created with a `POST`.

Notes:
- Data created or modified in each environment will not affect the other.
- Data cannot be transfered from one environment to the other.
